# Project Instructions

##Overview
This is a project that incorporates webpack. It also entails using a different API and a SDK to make API calls. 

##Step 1
To start the server either use NPM start or Yarn Start

## Step 2
Jest was used to test some of the code. To see the jest tests use command yarn jest websiteCheck.test.js for the one file and yarn jest formhandler.test.js for the other file.

## Step 3 
You should build the project next. You can do that by using the command Yarn build-prod
You can then use the development mode to see the page by using the command Yarn build-dev

## Step 4 
The page will popup in which you should be on port 8000. 

## Step 5
Enter a correct url and the api will be called providing you information on sentimental analysis for the page you picked. If you did not enter a correct website then an alert will appear giving you instructions on the proper way to enter a proper URL.
